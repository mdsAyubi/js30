# JavaScript 30

## Lesson 1 - JS Drum Kit

* Use of `data-key` for attaching arbitrary information in markup.
* HTML5 `kbd` for keyboard
* `audio.currentTime = 0` will rewind the audio element
* `element.classList` can be used to add/remove/toggle classes
* `transitionend` for adding events when the transition ends
* `transform` for the name of the event property

## Lesson 2 - CSS/JS Clock

* `transform-origin` for the origin of transformation
* `transform` for actual transformation
* `transition-timing-function` for the effects. One of the option is `cubic-bezier`

## Lesson 3 - CSS Variables

* Can change with JS
* Declared on some element e.g `:root`
* `this.dataset` on elements : an object than contains all the data attributes
* Can be scoped as well. The more specific wins.
